##Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r reading data, echo=T}
data<-read.csv("activity.csv", header=T, sep=",")
data$date<-as.Date(data$date)
weekday<-weekdays(data$date)
data<-cbind(data, weekday)

summary(data)
```

##What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r total steps per day, echo=TRUE}
total_steps <- with(data, aggregate(steps, by = list(date), FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE))
names(total_steps)<-cbind("date","steps")

hist(total_steps$steps, xlab="total steps per day", main="total steps per day", col="indianred3")

```
![plot of chunk total steps per day](figure/total_steps_per_day.png) 

What are the mean and the median of total number of steps per day?

```{r mean and median, echo=TRUE}
mean(total_steps$steps)
median(total_steps$steps)
```

##What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r daily activity pattern, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)

daily_steps <- with(data, aggregate(steps, by = list(interval), FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE))
names(daily_steps)<-cbind("interval","steps")
ggplot(daily_steps, aes(interval, steps))+geom_line()+xlab("5 minutes intervals")

```

Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r interval with maximum number of steps, echo=TRUE}
daily_steps[which(daily_steps$steps==max(daily_steps)),1]
```

##Imputing missing values

Total number of rows with NAs

```{r missing values, echo=T}
sum(is.na(data$steps))
```

Creation of a new dataset, equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in. Given the high number of NA's I chose to replace them with mean number of the corresponding day.

```{r new dataset, echo=T}
imputed_steps <- total_steps$steps[match(data$date, total_steps$date)]
newdata<- transform(data, steps = ifelse(is.na(data$steps), yes = imputed_steps, no = data$steps))
newtotal_steps <- with(newdata, aggregate(steps, by = list(date), FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE))
names(newtotal_steps)<-cbind("date","steps")

hist(newtotal_steps$steps, xlab="total steps per day", main="total steps per day", col="indianred3")

```

What are the mean and the median of total number of steps per day with this new dataset?

```{r new mean and median, echo=TRUE}
mean(newtotal_steps$steps)
median(newtotal_steps$steps)
```

##Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

Creation of a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend"

```{r processing dataset, echo=T}
daylist<-as.character(newdata$weekday)
day<- ifelse(daylist %in% c("samedi","dimanche"), "weekend", "weekday")
finaldata<-cbind(newdata, day)
summary(finaldata)

```

Plotting of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis)

```{r weekday vs weekend plot, echo=T}
final_daily_steps <- with(finaldata, aggregate(steps~interval+day, FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE))
ggplot(final_daily_steps, aes(interval, steps))+facet_grid(.~day)+geom_line()+xlab("5 minutes intervals")+ggtitle("average number of steps, weekdays vs weekends")

```
